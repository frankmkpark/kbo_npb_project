# kbo_npb_project

This repository supports a CS8674 summer research course focused on building a predictive framework for evaluating player transitions from the **Korea Baseball Organization (KBO)** and **Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB)** leagues into **Major League Baseball (MLB)**.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a structured dataset and apply machine learning models to understand which KBO or NPB players are most likely to succeed when transitioning to MLB. This involves:

- Curating comprehensive datasets from KBO and NPB
- Building a player database (biographical, statistical, and transition data)
- Applying ML algorithms (e.g., neural networks, Bayesian models) to assess predictive power
- Validating predictions on past player transitions

This work is conducted by **Myungkeun Park** under the supervision of **Prof. Eric Gerber**.
